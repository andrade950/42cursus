   - **Project Norms**:
      - All functions are implemented following the 42 norminette.
      - Dynamically allocated memory is freed correctly.
      - Includes a `Makefile` to compile the library with various rules for cleaning, compiling with bonus functions, etc.
      - The `libft.h` header contains declarations for all the functions implemented in the library, making it easier to use and maintain.

   - **Makefile**:
      - The `Makefile` automates the compilation process for the `libft` library. It includes several rules that streamline building and cleaning up the library files:
      
         - **Rules**:
           - `make` or `make all`: Compiles all `.c` files listed in the source files section of the `Makefile` and generates the static library `libft.a`. This library can be linked to other projects in the cursus to utilize the functions implemented.
           - `make clean`: Deletes all object files (`.o` files) generated during compilation. This rule is useful to clear intermediate files without removing the final `libft.a` library.
           - `make fclean`: Performs a full clean, deleting both object files and the `libft.a` library. This rule is typically used when you want to remove all compiled files and start the build process from scratch.
           - `make re`: This rule is a shortcut that runs `make fclean` followed by `make all`, effectively rebuilding the library from scratch.

         - **Bonus Rule**:
           - `make bonus`: Compiles additional bonus functions and includes them in the `libft.a` library. These bonus functions provide additional functionality, such as handling linked lists (`ft_lst*` functions), which are often required in other                   projects of the cursus.

         - **Variables**:
           - `CC`: Specifies the compiler, usually `gcc`.
           - `CFLAGS`: Contains compiler flags (e.g., `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`), ensuring the code is compiled with strict error and warning checks in line with 42's norms.

         - The `Makefile` ensures that only modified `.c` files are recompiled, improving efficiency in development and debugging. It follows standard `Makefile` conventions, making it easy for any developer familiar with `Makefiles` to use.

        - **Example Usage**:
           - Run `make` to compile the library.
           - Use `make clean` or `make fclean` to remove intermediate files and the library.
           - Run `make bonus` to include bonus functions if needed.

   - **libft.h File**:
      - The `libft.h` file is the main header for the `libft` library. It contains:
        
         - **Function Declarations**: All functions implemented in `libft` are declared here. This allows other files that include `libft.h` to use these functions without needing to redeclare them.
         
         - **Required Libraries**: It includes essential standard libraries such as `<stdlib.h>`, `<unistd.h>`, and `<string.h>`, ensuring that the functions have access to standard C definitions and functionalities.
         
         - **Type and Structure Definitions**: Contains type definitions and structures (such as `t_list`), used for linked list manipulation in the bonus functions. The `t_list` structure, for example, is utilized in `ft_lst*` functions and is                      defined with members like `content` (to hold the node’s content) and `next` (to point to the next node).

      - **Example of the t_list Structure**:
        
        ```c
        typedef struct s_list
        {
            void            *content;
            struct s_list   *next;
        } t_list;
        ```

      - **Purpose**: The `libft.h` serves as a central location for all function declarations and necessary includes for the `libft` library. Once compiled, other projects can simply include `libft.h` to access all functions and structures provided by             the library.

      - **Usage**: Any file that wants to use `libft` functions can include `libft.h` with `#include "libft.h"`, making the entire library accessible with a single include line.

### 2. 📄 [get_next_line](get_next_line)
A function that returns lines read from a file descriptor, exploring concepts like static variables in C.

<details>
  <summary> 🛈 get_next_line Project Details</summary>

- **Objective**: Develop the `get_next_line()` function that returns a line read from a file descriptor, including the newline character (`\n`) if present.

- **Requirements**:
  - Repeated calls to `get_next_line()` should allow reading the file line by line.
  - If there is nothing left to read or an error occurs, the function should return `NULL`.
  - It should work for both file reading and standard input (`stdin`).
  - The returned line should include the newline character unless the end of the file is reached and it doesn't end with `\n`.

- **Function Name and Files**:
  - Function: `get_next_line`
  - Files: `get_next_line.c`, `get_next_line_utils.c`, `get_next_line.h`

- **Parameters and Return Value**:
  - Parameters:
    - `fd`: the file descriptor to read from.
  - Return:
    - A string containing the read line, or `NULL` if there is nothing more to read or if an error occurred.

- **Allowed External Functions**:
  - `read`, `malloc`, `free`

- **Project Guidelines**:
  - The code must comply with the 42 *norminette*.
  - Dynamically allocated memory must be properly freed, with no leaks.

- **Challenges**:
  - Efficiently use static variables to store unprocessed data between calls.
  - Handle different buffer sizes and unpredictable behavior from file descriptors.

- **Prototype**:
  ```c
  char *get_next_line(int fd);

- **Bonus**:
   - Implementation that supports multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
   - Use only one static variable.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```c
  #include "get_next_line.h"
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    char *line;

    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL) {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }
    close(fd);
    return 0;
  }

- **Important Considerations**:
   - Test with various `BUFFER_SIZE` values (e.g., 1, 42, 9999).
   - Ensure that the function reads only what is necessary to return each line.
   - Handle errors such as null pointers and invalid file descriptors.

### 2. 📡 [minitalk](https://github.com/andrade950/42minitalk)
An implementation of interprocess communication using UNIX signals.

<details>
  <summary> 🛈 Minitalk Project Details</summary>

- **Objective**: Create a communication program between a client and a server using UNIX signals.

- **Functionality**:
  - The **server** must be started first and display its PID upon initialization.
  - The **client** receives the server's PID and the string to be sent as parameters.
  - The client sends the string to the server using only the `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals.
  - The server receives the string and quickly prints it to the standard output.
  - The server must be able to handle multiple clients without needing to restart.

- **Allowed Functions**:  
  | Function       | Description |
  |--------------|-------------|
  | `write`      | Writes to the standard output |
  | `ft_printf`  | Prints formatted messages |
  | `signal`     | Defines a signal handler |
  | `sigemptyset` | Initializes an empty signal set |
  | `sigaddset`  | Adds a signal to the set |
  | `sigaction`  | Defines actions for signals |
  | `kill`       | Sends signals to processes |
  | `getpid`     | Retrieves the current process PID |
  | `malloc`     | Allocates memory dynamically |
  | `free`       | Frees allocated memory |

- **Makefile**:
  - Automates the compilation process for `minitalk`.
  - **Rules**:
    - `make` or `make all`: Compiles `client` and `server`.
    - `make clean`: Removes object files (`.o`).
    - `make fclean`: Removes compiled files and executables.
    - `make re`: Recompiles the project from scratch.

- **Usage Example**:
  ```bash
  # Start the server
  ./server
  # The server will display its PID, for example: 12345

  # Run the client to send a message to the server
  ./client 12345 "Hello, Minitalk!"
  ```

- **Challenges and Learning Outcomes**:

A small 2D game using the MiniLibX library.

<details>
  <summary> 🛈 So_Long Project Details</summary>

- **Objective**: Create a basic 2D game where a player collects items and reaches an exit while navigating a map.

- **Functionality**:
  - The game loads a map from a `.ber` file and renders it using MiniLibX.
  - The player must collect all collectibles before reaching the exit.
  - The player moves using **W, A, S, D** or arrow keys.
  - The game keeps track of the movement count and displays it in the terminal.
  - The map must follow specific formatting rules (walls, collectibles, exit, and player position).
  - The game window must close cleanly when pressing **ESC** or clicking the close button.

- **Allowed Functions**:  
  | Function       | Description |
  |--------------|-------------|
  | `open`, `close`, `read`, `write` | File handling and input/output |
  | `malloc`, `free` | Memory allocation |

  make
  
  # Run the game with a map file
  ./so_long maps/level1.ber
  ```

- **Map Format**:
  - The map must be composed of the following characters:
    - `0` → Empty space
    - `1` → Wall
    - `C` → Collectible
    - `E` → Exit
    - `P` → Player's starting position
  - Example of a valid `.ber` map:
    ```
    111111
    1P0C01
    100001
    1C0E01
    111111
    ```
  - The map must be **rectangular**, enclosed by walls, and contain **at least one exit, one collectible, and one player position**.

- **Bonus Features (if implemented)**:

A simplified shell inspired by **Bash**, developed to deepen the understanding of processes, signals, and file descriptors in Unix systems.

<details>
  <summary> 🛈 Minishell Project Details</summary>

- **Objective**:  
  Develop a minimalist command-line shell that mimics **Bash** behavior. The project explores process management, redirections, pipes, signals, and environment variables.

- **Program Name**: `minishell`

- **Authorized Functions**:  
  Includes but is not limited to:
  - `readline`, `add_history`, `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `write`
  - `fork`, `execve`, `wait`, `waitpid`, `pipe`, `dup`, `dup2`

  - and more — covering the main Unix system calls used in shell development.

- **Description**:  
  The shell:
  - Displays a **prompt** and waits for user input.  
  - Maintains a **working history** of commands.  
  - Searches for executables using **PATH** or absolute/relative paths.  
  - Handles **environment variable expansion** (`$VAR`, `$?`).  
  - Implements **pipes (`|`)** to connect command outputs and inputs.  
  - Supports **redirections**:
    - `<` input redirection  
    - `>` output redirection  
    - `>>` append output redirection  
    - `<<` heredoc (reads until a specified delimiter)
  - Manages **signals** like Bash:
    - `Ctrl-C` → Displays a new prompt  
    - `Ctrl-D` → Exits the shell  
    - `Ctrl-\` → Ignored  
  - Handles **quotes** properly:
    - `'` (single quotes) prevent interpretation  
    - `"` (double quotes) allow `$` expansions but not other special characters  

- **Built-in Commands**:
  | Command | Description |
  |----------|-------------|
  | `echo [-n]` | Prints text to standard output |
  | `cd [path]` | Changes the current directory |
  | `pwd` | Prints the current working directory |

  - No global structures or additional data may be stored globally.

- **Makefile**:
  - Must include standard rules: `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`.
  - Compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
  - Uses the `libft` library for utility functions.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```bash
  $ ./minishell
  minishell$ echo "Hello, world!"
  Hello, world!
  minishell$ ls -l | grep minishell > output.txt
  minishell$ cat output.txt

- **Challenges and Learning Outcomes**:
  - Deep understanding of **process creation, signal handling**, and **file descriptor management**.

### 2. 🍝 [Philosophers](https://github.com/andrade950/42philosophers)

An exploration of multithreading and synchronization in C, simulating the famous Dining Philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.

<details> <summary> 🛈 Philosophers Project Details</summary>

- **Objective**:  
  Implement a simulation where several philosophers alternate between eating, sleeping, and thinking — ensuring that none starve, and managing access to shared resources (forks) using **threads** and **mutexes**.

- **Program Name**: `philo`

- **Allowed Functions**:  
  `memset`, `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `write`,  
  `usleep`, `gettimeofday`,  
  `pthread_create`, `pthread_detach`, `pthread_join`,  
  `pthread_mutex_init`, `pthread_mutex_destroy`, `pthread_mutex_lock`, `pthread_mutex_unlock`

- **Arguments**:  
  ```bash
  ./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
  number_of_philosophers → Number of philosophers (and forks).
  ```
  
    - **time_to_die (ms)** → Time a philosopher can live without eating.
    - **time_to_eat (ms)** → Duration a philosopher spends eating (holding both forks).
    - **time_to_sleep (ms)** → Duration a philosopher sleeps after eating.
    - **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional)** → If all philosophers eat this many times, the simulation ends.
 
- **Behavior**:

   - Each philosopher is represented by a **thread**.
   - Each fork is protected by a **mutex**.
   - Philosophers perform the cycle: **thinking → taking forks → eating → sleeping**.
   - The simulation stops when:
      - A philosopher dies (hasn’t eaten within `time_to_die`), or
      - All have eaten at least the required number of times (if provided).
    
- **Output Format**:
  ```bash
  timestamp_in_ms [X] has taken a fork
  timestamp_in_ms [X] is eating
  timestamp_in_ms [X] is sleeping
  timestamp_in_ms [X] is thinking
  timestamp_in_ms [X] died
   ```
  
   - `timestamp_in_ms`: time since simulation start.
   - `X`: philosopher number.
   - Death must be logged within 10 ms of occurring.
   - Logs must not overlap or interleave.

- **Global Rules**:

   - **No global variables**.
   - **No data races** — all shared data protected by mutexes.
   - The program must free all dynamically allocated memory and avoid leaks.
 
- **Makefile**:

   - Rules: `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`
   - Compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pthread`
   - Output: `philo`
 
- **Example Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./philo 5 800 200 200
   0 [1] has taken a fork
   0 [1] has taken a fork
   0 [1] is eating
   0 [5] has taken a fork
   0 [3] has taken a fork
   0 [3] has taken a fork
   0 [3] is eating
   200 [1] is sleeping
   200 [3] is sleeping
   200 [5] has taken a fork
   200 [5] is eating
   300 [2] has taken a fork
   300 [2] has taken a fork
   300 [2] is eating
   400 [3] is thinking
   400 [1] is thinking
   400 [5] is sleeping
   400 [4] has taken a fork
   400 [4] has taken a fork
   400 [4] is eating
   500 [1] has taken a fork
   500 [2] is sleeping
   500 [1] has taken a fork
   500 [1] is eating
   500 [3] has taken a fork
   600 [4] is sleeping
   ...
   ```

- **Learning Outcomes**:

   - Understand **multithreading** and **race condition prevention**.
   - Learn **synchronization** using **mutexes**.
   - Manage timing and concurrency safely in C.
   - Design deterministic behavior in concurrent environments.
